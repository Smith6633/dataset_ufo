# dataset_ufo/code
Web scraping code used to create the dataset.

Python code was used to create the web scraper using Beautiful Soup in a Jupiter notebook. 
The code makes two passes, one to get the list of ufo sightings and one to scrape the sighting details. 

R code is used for cleaning and analysis. 
1. data-integration.R: run this first to horizontally and vertically integrate the output files from the python scraping activities.
